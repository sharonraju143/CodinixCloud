Observations:

1. Even if the min and max nodes are above "0" still when you execute the pipeline and check the cluster it is still shown as
   single node 

2. Even if the Vm_size is not compatible with the Datbricks_Spark_version the pipeline will be executed but you will see in the portal that the Vm-size is not compatible
